# Objective

**Goal:** Create a functional web application aligned with one of the suggested themes that enables user interaction.

The application is intended to be used primarily by small groups to share relevant information related to a specific theme. Typically, there is a mechanism for offering activities/services that users can join.

This is a prototype application and should only implement fundamental aspects.

## **Technical Requirements**

1. Frontend:
   - Develop a responsive and functional interface using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a **frontend framework** (suggested: **Svelte**).
   - Implement at least **2 main pages** (e.g., home page and details page).
2. Backend:
   - Implement a basic REST API using **Node.js** with **Express**.
   - Create at least **3 endpoints** for CRUD operations (e.g., list, add, and remove resources).
3. Database:
   - Use a database (preferably MongoDB).
4. Authentication:
   - Implement a basic user login and registration system.

## **Final Deliverables**

- Organized and well-commented source code in a GitHub repository.
- Basic documentation (e.g., setup and execution instructions) in a **README.md** file.
- Deploy the application on **render.com** or **vercel.com**.
- Functional demonstration of the application (e.g., a short video or live presentation).

# Rules & Evaluation

## Groups

- Maximum of 3 members per group.

## Due Date

- January 22, 2025.

## GitHub Classroom Repository

1. The project will be assigned as a group assignment. When a student accepts the assignment, they can either create a new team or join an existing one.
2. For each group project, **GitHub Classroom** automatically generates a unique shared repository for the team.

### README.md

The GitHub repository should include setup and usage instructions, accessible through a README.md file, which must contain:

- Identification of group members.
- The GitHub repository URL.
- The deployment URL.

Additionally, the README.md should provide a detailed project description (mini-report) highlighting its goal, libraries, frameworks, and any other relevant implementation details.
It should also include a paragraph summarizing the main contributions of each member.

### Build / Install / Configure

1. The project should, as much as possible, include a build and installation script.
2. Provide detailed instructions for any configurations required.

## Deployment

1. The app should be operational on the **render.com** or **vercel.com** server.

## Moodle Submission

Each student must submit the following on Moodle:

1. Group identification.
2. GitHub link.
3. Deployment link (render.com or vercel.com).

## Evaluation

Having a fully functional project is critical.
Isolated missing functionalities will be penalized less than global malfunctions or a non-functional application.

### Not Evaluated:

- Aesthetic concerns (non-usability-related).
- Excessive complexity.

### Bonus Points:

- OAuth2 support.
- Mobile-friendly design or version + notifications.
- Accessibility and usability.
- Use of Svelte.
